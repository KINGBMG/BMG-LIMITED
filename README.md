However, the North Central region shows a concerning decline in sales, necessitating strategic interventions to boost performance there. Additionally, WorkDays are identified as the primary revenue drivers, emphasizing the importance of regular sales efforts. With Service Plans representing a substantial 71% of total revenue, there is a clear opportunity for BMG Limited to enhance its offerings in this area. To optimize future performance, BMG should focus on reinforcing its strengths in high-performing markets, addressing weaknesses in lagging regions, and leveraging its successful Service Plans to foster growth.
